# Design Choices

## Fonts 
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that suited the sleek modern design of the website. The font I chose was [Radio Canada](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Radio+Canada ). I felt this font was very clear and blended very well with the overall design.

## Icons 
I chose to use the very suitable icons from [Font Awsome Library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons seemed modern and easy to distinguish at a glance.

## Colours 

Initially I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to generate the color palette which would later be altered slightly during !!!!!!ADD link to color testng !![testing](#testing "Testing"). 


The main colours used were: 

* --#DBDBDB in the body.
* --#5D7989 in the heading.
* --#000000 as the font and icon color.

These can be seen in the responsive design [above](#rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock).

In addition Green and Red were used as a box-shadowing to indicate whether the user answered corretly or incorrectly. The heading color was used to indicate a draw.
